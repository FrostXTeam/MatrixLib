MatrixLib | Mark 1 | Confi 1.0

***FrostX matrix library (language core)***

------------------------//------------------------

Creators and Proprietors:
- Lucas Barbosa

------------------------//------------------------

**System Overview**
FrostX is a interpreted language built on foundations of
machine learning paradigms and AI networks to make
programming much smarter then it should be.

The FrostX matrix will be comprised of two main cores:
  - Lexical analyser
	- System parser
together these cores will operate to interpret files and
parse the data within to output designate results.

The FrostX martix will be written in C++ as opposed to python
as explicit pointers to heap will be required and for many other
reasons. Also because C++ is a far superior language to Java. 

**Instalation**
The most current source code for the FrostX language is
available on GitHub @ www.githib.com/FrostXTeam/ and more
especifically for the matrix library, which can be found
@ www.github.com/FrostXTeam/MatrixLib.
The entire language will be open source and for free (as of
current situations). Special rights have not been reserved for
any parties.
